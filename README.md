# Prework - iOS101 Prework App 

Submitted by: Uyen Duong

iOS101 Prework App is an app that freshly introduces the very basic functionalities and UI elements of an iOS simulator environment using Swift in Xcode.

Time spent: 2.5 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

App 1: Instagram
- Changing the background color of the messages screen
- Deleting old messages without notifying the recipients

App 2: Messenger
- Incorporating many elements like GIF, stickers, sharing files/screens, etc.
- Switching accounts with ease

App 3: Facebook
- Looking back on memories of the same day in previous years
- Recommending contents algorithm


Idea for an App: I would like to build an app that can serve as an interactive portfolio where my information, projects, previous experience and education as well as any contact information can be found by having the users or potentially recruiters interact with the features in the app.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: Navigating around Xcode for the first time was difficult.
